# 1D Heat Loss Models Validation Experiment
Contains data from the model validation in the 1D Heat Loss Models to Predict the Aquifer Temperature Profile during Hot/Cold Water Injection Project. The data include two COMSOL models (2D axisymmetric benchmark model and 2D Vinsome model), one python code (1D Vinsome based FEM numerical simulation), one matlab main code (1D Newton analytical solution and all results comparison visualization), and output files generated from the above models.
